📝 7. Conclusion
This project successfully applied K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for market segmentation on the UCI Online Retail II dataset.
Through clustering, we were able to identify different types of customers based on their purchasing behavior.
Key findings:
Certain groups of customers show high purchase frequency, making them suitable for loyalty programs & targeted marketing.
Low-frequency customers can be targeted using discounts or promotional offers.
GMM provided more flexible cluster boundaries compared to K-Means, which assumes rigid cluster shapes.

Overall, this project demonstrates how unsupervised learning can help businesses:
✔ Improve marketing strategies
✔ Understand customer behavior
✔ Boost sales using data-driven decisions

In the future, we can improve the model by:
Using more advanced clustering techniques (DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering, SOM)
Adding RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) features
Applying Deep Learning-based clustering
